# Weather Dashboard

## Description

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city


Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
My motivation for the project was to get familiar with utilizing server side APIs. I was able to mostly get the css to work and get the localstorage to store arrays of locations. I struggled with retrieving and displaying the information on the page. I am unfortunately having to submit this unfinished project but in the coming days I plan to return to properly display the weather information using fetch, and then retrieving the cities from the local storage and append them to the page.
